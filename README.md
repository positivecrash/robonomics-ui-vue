# Robonomics UI Vue

A set of Vue 3 UI components for the [Robonomics dApp](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics.app).  
This package provides shared interface elements and utilities used in the decentralized frontend of Robonomics app.

---

## 📦 Build

This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to build a Vue 3 component library.

---

### 🔧 Production Build

To build the library for production (for publishing or packaging):

```bash
yarn build
```

This will:

- Compile the library into the `dist/` folder
- Copy the following metadata files into `dist/`:
  - `package.json`
  - `README.md`
  - `LICENSE`
  - `NOTICE`
  - `AUTHORS`

---

### 🧪 Local Development Build

To build and test the package locally with a dependent dApp project:

```bash
yarn build-dev
```

This will:

- Build the library
- Copy the compiled output directly into the dApp’s `node_modules/robonomics-ui-vue/` folder

The path is configured via a local config file:

```js
// build.config.local.mjs
export const dappPackagePath = '/absolute/path/to/your-dapp/node_modules/robonomics-ui-vue/';
```

Use `build.config.example.mjs` as a reference.

> **Note:** This file is ignored via `.gitignore` and should not be committed.

## 🚀 Publish a new version

1. **Build the library (optional for local checks)**

   ~~~bash
   yarn build
   ~~~

2. **Bump version & commit**

   ~~~bash
   git add package.json
   git commit -m "chore: release vX.Y.Z"
   git push
   ~~~

3. **Create an annotated tag**

   ~~~bash
   git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"
   ~~~

4. **Push the tag**

   ~~~bash
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ~~~

That’s all! The GitHub Action defined in `.github/workflows/publish.yml` will:

- Build the project  
- Run `npm publish --access public` **from `dist/`**, so only the compiled package is uploaded  
- Create a GitHub Release with autogenerated notes  

> **Manual publish (without CI)**  
> ~~~bash
> yarn build && cd dist && npm publish --access public
> ~~~  
> Ensure `NPM_TOKEN` with **publish** permission is configured.
